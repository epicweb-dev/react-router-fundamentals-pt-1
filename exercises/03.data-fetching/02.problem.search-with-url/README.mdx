# URL state management

One of the terms tied strongly with React Router is "Progressive Enhancement".
Progressive enhancement is the idea of building web applications that work for
all users, regardless of their browser capabilities or network conditions. This
means that even if a user has JavaScript disabled, they should still be able to
access the core functionality of the application.

To achieve this, React Router encourages developers to use the Web API's.
This means, for example, that instead of relying solely on JavaScript to
manage application state, we can use the URL to store and retrieve state information.

This approach allows your users to have your website work without JavaScript,
as the URL is always accessible, and servers can render pages based on the URL alone.

## `Form` component

If you've heard of React Router before, you might be familiar with their `Form` component.
This is a wrapper around the native HTML `<form>` element that enhances its functionality
by integrating it with React Router's navigation system. The `Form` component allows you
to submit forms without a full page reload, providing a smoother user experience.

The reason it wraps the native `<form>` element is to ensure that the form can still
be submitted and processed by the server if JavaScript is disabled in the user's browser.
This allows us to build user interfaces that work for everyone!

By default the `Form` component does a `GET` request to the current URL,
including all form fields as query parameters. This means that the form data is appended
to the URL as key-value pairs, making it easy to grab the data from the URL.

You can also change the method to `POST` if you want to submit the form data, this
will submit the data to an `action` function defined on the route instead of the `loader`.

## Exercise Goals

In this exercise, we will implement a search functionality for our product listing
page. The search term will be stored in the URL as a query parameter, allowing users
to share links to specific search results and bookmark their searches for later.

The header component will have a search input field where users can type their search queries.
When the form is submitted, the search term will be added to the URL as a query parameter.
