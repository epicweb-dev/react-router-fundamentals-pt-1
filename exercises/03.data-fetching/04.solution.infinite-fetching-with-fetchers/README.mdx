# Infinite Scrolling with useFetcher hook

One more exercise to go! You have done an amazing job so far.

In this one we tackled infinite scrolling using the `useFetcher` hook provided by React Router.
We learned how to load data without navigating away from the current page, and how to use an intersection observer
to detect when the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page.

Now all that is left to do for us it to fetch the data on the singular product page using loaders and we're done!
 

You're doing great! ðŸš€
