# Filtering, sorting and pagination

Well done! You have successfully added filtering, sorting, and pagination to your product listing page.
This allows your users to easily find and navigate through products based on their preferences.

Now with that out of the way, you might've noticed that the pagination works, but it doesn't load more products!
Let's fix that in the next exercise by using fetchers and infinite scrolling.

🧝‍♀️ I'm going to help you out for the next exercise, I'll create an intersection observer hook to let us listen
to when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page so we can load more products automatically! The rest is up to you!

You're doing great! 🚀
