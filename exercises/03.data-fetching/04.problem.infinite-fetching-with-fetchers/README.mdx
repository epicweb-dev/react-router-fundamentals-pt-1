# Infinite Scrolling with useFetcher hook

Now that we have everything in place, the lest step in improving our products listing page is to implement infinite scrolling.
This will allow us to load more products as the user scrolls down the page, providing a seamless browsing experience.

## `useFetcher` hook

The `useFetcher` hook from React Router is a powerful tool that allows you to perform data fetching and mutations without causing a full page navigation.
When you call `useFetcher`, it returns an object that contains several properties and methods to help you manage data fetching.
One of the key properties is `load`, which is a function that you can call to fetch data from a specified URL.

By using the `load` method, you can fetch additional data (like more products) and update your component's state accordingly. We will explore this
hook further in upcoming workshops, but for now, it's important to understand that it allows us to fetch data without navigating away from the current page.

You typically use this hook when you don't want to add an event to the browsers `history` stack, for example when implementing infinite scrolling.

## Exercise Goals

- Add infinite scrolling to the products listing page using the `useFetcher` hook.
- Use an intersection observer to detect when the user has scrolled to the bottom of the page.
- Fetch and append more products to the existing list as the user scrolls down.
- Ensure that the infinite scrolling works seamlessly with the existing filtering, sorting, and pagination features.
- Provide feedback to the user when new products are being loaded (e.g., a loading spinner).
