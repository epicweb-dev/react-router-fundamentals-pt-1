# Filtering, sorting and pagination

Now that you have a working products listing page, it's time to enhance it with filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities.
In this exercise, you'll implement the following features:

- **Filtering**: Allow users to filter products based on categories, brands, and price ranges.
- **Sorting**: Enable users to sort products by price
- **Pagination**: Implement pagination to manage large sets of products effectively.

We will be using the URL as the source of truth and we will learn how to do all this in a way that supports progressive enhancement.
We will rely on the web platform and HTML forms to manage the state of our filters, sorting, and pagination.
We will also use the `useNavigation` hook to provide feedback to the user when the page is loading new data.

## `useNavigation` hook

The `useNavigation` hook from React Router provides information about the current navigation state of your application.
This hook is particularly useful for providing feedback to users during navigation events, such as when a page is loading new data.

When you call `useNavigation`, it returns an object that contains details about the current navigation state. One of the key properties of this object is `state`,
which can have one of the following values:

- `"idle"`: Indicates that there is no ongoing navigation. The application is in a stable state.
- `"loading"`: Indicates that a navigation event is in progress, and new data is being loaded.
- `"submitting"`: Indicates that a form submission is in progress.

By checking the value of `navigation.state`, you can conditionally render UI elements to inform users about the current state of the application.
For example, you might display a loading spinner when the state is `"loading"` or disable form inputs when the state is `"submitting"`.

This hook can also be used to show optimistic UI by accessing the `formData` property which is filled with the submitted data
during a form submission. This allows you to reflect the changes immediately in the UI before the server responds, enhancing the user experience.

## Exercise Goals

In this exercise, you will enhance the products listing page by implementing filtering, sorting, and pagination features.
You will first use the prepared method for extracting all the search parameters from the URL and then apply those filters to the products listing.
You will pass back the info to the client and then use that info to render true information instead of the hardcoded info we had before.
You will also learn how to use the `useNavigation` hook to provide feedback to users when the page is loading new data.
