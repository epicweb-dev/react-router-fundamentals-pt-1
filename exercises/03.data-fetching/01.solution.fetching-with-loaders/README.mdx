## Data fetching with loaders

Well done! You have successfully added loaders to multiple routes and you've learned
how to optimize data fetching by parallelizing requests using `Promise.all`, how
to call a database and return data to your components, and how to read URL parameters
to fetch data based on those parameters.

We also completely removed the mocked data and replaced it with a real database using
Prisma and SQLite, which is a great skill to have when building real-world applications.

Now that you fully understand loaders and how to use them effectively, let's
move onto the next module when you're ready!
