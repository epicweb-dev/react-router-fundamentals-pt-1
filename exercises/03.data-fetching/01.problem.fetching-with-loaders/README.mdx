# Data fetching with loaders

Amazing work so far! Now is the time for us to dive deep into data fetching using
loaders in React Router. Loaders are a powerful feature that allows us to fetch
data before rendering a route, ensuring that our components have the data they need
right from the start.

## Loaders Overview

Loaders are functions that run on the server (or during the build process in SPA mode) 
before a route is rendered. (Keep this in mind if you want navigations to be instant)
They can fetch data from APIs, databases, or any other source, and the data they return
is made available to the route's component via the `useLoaderData` hook or the
`loaderData` prop on the route component. First is used in components far from the route
definition, second is used in the route definition itself, as a rule-of-thumb, prefer the 
second one.

Loaders return serialized data using `turbo-stream` which means you can return complex
data structures, including nested objects and arrays, without worrying about serialization
issues. (Think of promises and how you could optimize your loaders by returning slow fetches)

Loaders can also redirect the user to different routes based on certain conditions,
such as authentication status or data availability. This allows us to handle routing
logic in a centralized manner, improving the overall structure of our application.

If a loader throws an error, React Router will catch it and render the nearest
error boundary, otherwise if a response is thrown it will either redirect if it's a 
redirect response (status 302) or also go to the nearest ErrorBoundary.

Because they run on a server you can cache their results using HTTP caching headers,
which can significantly improve the performance of your application by reducing
the number of requests made to your backend services, or improving the response of
the loaders themselves, this is useful for data that doesn't change often.

## Exercise Goals


In this exercise, we will set up loaders for our routes to fetch product data from
a database. 

üßù‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Has already set up a database for us! 

The point of this exercise is to get comfortable with loaders, understand how they work,
and how we can optimize them to perform faster when it comes to fetching the data itself.

We have 3 different routes that will require data fetching, and each aims to teach you
a different concept of data fetching with loaders:

1. **Basic Data Fetching**: In the first route, we will implement a simple loader that fetches
   all products from the database and displays them on the page. This will help you understand
   the basics of setting up a loader and using the fetched data in your components.
2. **Using URL Parameters**: The second route will introduce URL parameters. We will create a loader
   that fetches a product based on the ID provided in the URL. This will teach you how to read
   URL parameters in loaders and use them to fetch specific data.
3. **Optimizing Data Fetching**: In the final route, we will focus on optimizing our data fetching.
   We will use a simple trick of parallelizing multiple data fetches to improve performance. This will help you
   understand how to make your loaders more efficient.
