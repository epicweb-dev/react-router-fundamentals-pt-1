# Registering Routes in React Router

You just registered your first routes in a react-router framework mode project! 🎉

In this exercise you learned how to use the `routes.ts` file to manually register your routes,
and you also learned how to create a utility function to make it easier to register routes
that share a common layout.

Even though I'm proud of you for completing this exercise, 👨‍💼 Peter the manager isn't! He
thinks this approach of manually registering routes is too tedious and time consuming. He wants you 
to find a better way to register routes in the next exercise. So let's move on to the
next exercise where you will learn how to use a third party
library to automatically detect and register your routes for you!

Take a breather, and let's continue once you're ready! 🚀
