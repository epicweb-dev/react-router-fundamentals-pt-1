# Using automatic route detection

Congratulations! You're successfully using automatic route detection in your React Router application! ðŸŽ‰

In this exercise, you have installed the `@react-router/fs-routes` package and registered your 
routes in the `app/routes.ts` file.

From now on, any route you add to the `app/routes` directory will be automatically detected
and registered in your application, saving you time and effort.


## Additional considerations

The package we used only supports a single layer of nested routes. If you need more complex
nesting, you can use the `remix-flat-routes` package instead, which supports deeper nesting,
and don't let the name fool you! It works perfectly fine with React Router framework mode projects.

Take a breather, and let's continue once you're ready! ðŸš€
