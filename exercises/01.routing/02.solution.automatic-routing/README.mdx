# Using automatic route detection

Congratulations! You're successfully using automatic route detection in your React Router application! 🎉

In this exercise, you have installed the `@react-router/fs-routes` package and registered your
routes in the `app/routes.ts` file.

From now on, any route you add to the `app/routes` directory will be automatically detected
and registered in your application, saving you time and effort.

🧝‍♀️ Now that we have the basic routing down, I'm going to help you out by adding UI and styling
your app for the next few exercises. Although, I don't really know how to add the stylesheets
and fonts to your app, so you will have to figure that part out on your own!

## Additional considerations

The package we used only supports a single layer of nested routes. If you need more complex
nesting, you can use the `remix-flat-routes` package instead, which supports deeper nesting,
and don't let the name fool you! It works perfectly fine with React Router framework mode projects.

Take a breather, and let's continue once you're ready! 🚀
