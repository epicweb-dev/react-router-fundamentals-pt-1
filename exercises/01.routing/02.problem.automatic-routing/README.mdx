# Using automatic route detection

Now that we understand how to define routes and use them effectively, let's use a package
from the React Router team to automatically detect and register routes for us!

## Exercise Overview

In this exercise, you will:

1. Install `@react-router/fs-routes` package.
2. Register those routes in the `app/routes.ts` file.

## Getting Started

To get started, find our helpful assistants comments in the `app/routes.ts` file. (They include 🐨 emoji)
