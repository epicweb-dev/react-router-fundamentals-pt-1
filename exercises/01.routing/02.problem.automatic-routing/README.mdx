# Using automatic route detection

👨‍💼 Peter doesn't want us spending our precious development time doing tedious
manual work. He wants us to find a better way to register routes in our application and that
is exactly what we are going to do in this exercise!

Now that we understand how to define routes and use them effectively, let's use a package
from the React Router team to automatically detect and register routes for us so we can focus
on building features instead of boilerplate.

## Exercise Overview

In this exercise, you will:

1. Install `@react-router/fs-routes` package.
2. Register those routes in the `app/routes.ts` file.

## Getting Started

To get started, find our helpful assistants comments in the `app/routes.ts` file. (They include 🐨 emoji)

You will need to install a new package to help you with automatic route detection:

```sh
npm install @react-router/fs-routes
```

Then, implement the following steps in the `app/routes.ts` file:

1. Import the `flatRoutes` function from `@react-router/fs-routes`.
2. Use the `flatRoutes` function to automatically detect and register all the routes in the
   `app/routes` directory.
