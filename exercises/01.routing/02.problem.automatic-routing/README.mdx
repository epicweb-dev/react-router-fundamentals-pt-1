# Using automatic route detection

👨‍💼 Peter doesn't want us spending our precious development time doing tedious
manual work. He wants us to find a better way to register routes in our application and that
is exactly what we are going to do in this exercise!

Now that we understand how to define routes and use them effectively, let's use a package
from the React Router team to automatically detect and register routes for us so we can focus
on building features instead of boilerplate.

## Exercise Goals

In this exercise, you will:

1. Use a custom convention to automatically detect and register routes in the `app/routes.ts` file.
2. Understand how automatic route detection works and how to leverage it in your projects.

To get started, find our helpful assistants comments in the `app/routes.ts` file. (They include 🐨 emoji)
