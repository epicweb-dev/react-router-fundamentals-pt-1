# Registering Routes in React Router

Welcome to your first exercise! In this exercise,
you will learn how to register routes in a React Router application.

## Understanding the `routes.ts` file

The `app/routes.ts` file is where you define the routes for your application. Each route corresponds to a specific URL path
and is associated with a React component that will be rendered when the user navigates to that path.

This file is picked up by the React Router vite plugin and is used to generate the routing configuration for your app.
What's important to keep in mind is that this in the end, is just a regular TypeScript file, so you can use all the features of TypeScript
to help you define your routes. You can fetch them from third-parties, define helper functions, and so on.

React router offers you a few utilities to help you define your routes more easily.

## Exercise Goals

In this exercise, you will:

1. Explore the `app/routes` directory.
2. Learn about the utilites offered by React Router to define routes.
3. Register those routes in the `app/routes.ts` file.
4. (Bonus) Create a utility to easily define landing page routes.

To get started, find our helpful assistants comments in the `app/routes.ts` file. (They include üê® emoji)
and implement the required routes for this project!
