# Registering Routes in React Router

Welcome to your first exercise! In this exercise,
you will learn how to register routes in a React Router application.

## Exercise Overview

In this exercise, you will:

1. Explore the `app/routes` directory.
2. Register those routes in the `app/routes.ts` file.
3. (Bonus) Create a utility to easily define landing page routes.

## Getting Started

To get started, find our helpful assistants comments in the `app/routes.ts` file. (They include 🐨 emoji) 
and implement the following routes:
- `Landing page layout` that wraps all the other routes (`./routes/_landing.tsx`).
- `/` - The index route that renders the landing page (`./routes/_landing._index/route.tsx`).
- `/about` - The about route that renders the `About` page (`./routes/_landing.about.tsx`).
- `/products` - The products route that renders the `Products` page (`./routes/_landing.products._index.tsx`).
- `/products/:productId` - The product details route that renders the `ProductDetails` page (`./routes/_landing.products.$productId.tsx`).
- `/contact` - The contact route that renders the `Contact` page (`./routes/_landing.contact.tsx`).
- `/cart` - The cart route that renders the `Cart` page (`./routes/_landing.cart.tsx`).
- `/terms-of-use` - The terms of use route that renders the `TermsOfUse` page (`./routes/_landing.terms-of-use.tsx`).
- `/terms-of-service` - The terms of service route that renders the `TermsOfService` page (`./routes/_landing.terms-of-service.tsx`).

> Bonus (only after completing the above): Create a utility function to easily define landing page routes.
> This utility should be used to define the routes above
