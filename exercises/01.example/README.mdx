# Routing

<h2>This module is all about routing in React Router! </h2> 

You will learn how to set up routes, register them manually, use third party libraries to 
add custom conventions, and how you can use JavaScript to define your routes dynamically.

To use routing effectively, you will need to understand how react-router framework picks up
your routes and how you can define and structure them in your application.

### Understanding the `app/routes` directory

The crucial part of this module is understanding how to register routes, and that is done
in the `app/routes.ts` file.

This is a special file that the vite plugin from `@react-router/dev` uses to automatically
register your routes by using the **default export** from this file.

The general structure of this file is as follows:

```ts
import { type RouteConfig } from "@react-router/dev/routes";  

// React Router uses this export to register your application routes
export default [
  // Defining routes here makes them available to react-router
] satisfies RouteConfig;
```

When you define your routes, the react-router vite plugin will automatically 
pick them up and make them available in your app, and it will also typegen 
the types into `.react-router` directory, which you can use to get type 
safety in your components (like type-safe params, etc.).

What is important to note here is that this is **just a regular JavaScript file**,
so you can use any JavaScript or TypeScript features to define your routes dynamically.
