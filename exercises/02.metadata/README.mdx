# Metadata

<h2>This module is all about metadata in React Router! </h2>
 
Metadata is an important part of any web application, and React Router provides
powerful tools to manage it effectively. Metadata is all the information that describes
your web page, such as titles, descriptions, social media tags, fonts, stylesheets and more.

In this module you will learn all about how to add metadata to your app!

We will cover the following topics:
- Adding global styles and fonts
- Managing document metadata
- Using the `meta` export
- Using the `links` export

Before we actually start adding metadata to our app, let's take a look at two ways of adding metadata
in `react-router`, through the `meta` and `links` exports or using React 19 directly.

## Using React 19 to manage metadata

From React 19 onwards, you can use JSX to hoist metadata directly into your documents head.
Here's an example of how to use JSX to add metadata to your app:

```tsx
export default function SomeRoute() {
  return (
    <>
      /** This gets hoisted into the document head */
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/global.css" />
    </>
  )
}
```

As you can see, you can add any valid HTML metadata tags directly in your component's JSX,
and React will automatically hoist them into the document head for you. This is a great way
to manage metadata in a more declarative way, and it works seamlessly with React Router.

However, it has a few drawbacks and pitfalls which we will explore throughout this module together!

## Using the `meta` and `links` exports

React Router provides two special exports, `meta` and `links`, which allow you to manage metadata
in a more structured way. The `meta` export is used to define metadata for a specific route, while 
the `links` export is used to define global metadata for your app.

Here's an example of how to use the `meta` and `links` exports:

```tsx
import { MetaFunction, LinksFunction } from 'react-router'
import globalStylesUrl from '~/styles/global.css'

export const meta: MetaFunction = () => {
  return {
    title: 'My App',
    description: 'This is my app',
  }
}

export const links: LinksFunction = () => {
  return [{ rel: 'stylesheet', href: globalStylesUrl }]
}
```

In this example, we're defining a title and description for our app using the `meta` export,
and we're adding a global stylesheet using the `links` export. This is a more structured way
to manage metadata in your app.

Both methods have their pros and cons, and it's important to understand when to use each one.
In the next exercises, we will explore both methods in more detail and learn how to use them 
effectively.

Take a deep breath, and let's continue once you're ready! ðŸš€
