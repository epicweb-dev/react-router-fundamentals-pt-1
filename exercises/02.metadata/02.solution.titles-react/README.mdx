Congratulations! You have completed the exercise. 🎉

In this exercise, you have used React 19 JSX metadata tags to add titles to your pages.

But we have a big problem!!

👨‍💼 Peter isn't happy with us!! He says we introduced a big bug in our app! Namely,
if you go to the products pages, especially on the individual product pages, the titles
are doubled and we have 2x titles per page! 😱

👨‍💼 He also doesn't like the fact that we don't have a shared prefix for our titles. He
expected every page to start with Epic Shop - `<Page Specific Title>` instead of what we
have now!

Let's fix this by using the `meta` export instead of React 19 JSX metadata tags to add titles
to our pages and also add a shared prefix to all our titles!

🧝‍♀️ Let's get you closer to implementing this by helping you out and adding some utilities
for metadata parsing and reading! You can find them in `app/utils/metadata.ts` in the
next exercise! I really hope this helps you out to make Peter happier!

🧝‍♀️ Also, I've removed all the `<title>` tags you added, Peter says he'd rather have no
titles at all, than buggy ones! So, you'll have to add them all again using the `meta`
export!

Take a breather, and let's continue once you're ready! 🚀
