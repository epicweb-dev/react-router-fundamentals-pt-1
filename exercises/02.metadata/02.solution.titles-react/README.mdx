Congratulations! You have completed the exercise. 🎉
 
In this exercise, you have used React 19 JSX metadata tags to add titles to your pages.

But we have a big problem!!

👨‍💼 Peter isn't happy with us!! He says we introduced a big bug in our app! Namely, 
if you go to the products pages, especially on the individual product pages, the titles
are doubled and we have 2x titles per page! 😱

👨‍💼 He also doesn't like the fact that we don't have a shared prefix for our titles. He
expected every page to start with Epic Shop - `<Page Specific Title>` instead of what we
have now!

Let's fix this by using the `meta` export instead of React 19 JSX metadata tags to add titles
to our pages and also add a shared prefix to all our titles!

Take a breather, and let's continue once you're ready! 🚀
