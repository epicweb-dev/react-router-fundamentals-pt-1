Well done! You have successfully added metadata to your routes using the `meta` export. 
This allows you to set dynamic titles for each page in your application by merging 
the parent route's metadata with the current route's metadata.

You have also ensured that all titles have a consistent prefix, "Epic Shop -", which
improves the branding and recognition of your application.

Now that you fully understand the `meta` export and how to use it effectively, let's
move onto the next module when you're ready!

You're doing great! ðŸš€
