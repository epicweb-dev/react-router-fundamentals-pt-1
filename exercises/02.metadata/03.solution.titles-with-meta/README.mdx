Well done! You have successfully added metadata to your routes using the `meta` export. 
This allows you to set dynamic titles for each page in your application by merging 
the parent route's metadata with the current route's metadata.

You have also ensured that all titles have a consistent prefix, "Epic Shop -", which
improves the branding and recognition of your application.

Another benefit of the approach we just implemented is that if you add a new route
and you forget to add a title there, it will fallback to the closest parent route's title,
which is a nice safety net to have.

Now that you fully understand the `meta` export and how to use it effectively, let's
move onto the next module when you're ready!

You're doing great! ðŸš€
