# Adding Titles with React 19

Now that we have the styling down, let's add some titles to our pages!

For any sort of public, user-facing website it is of utmost importance to have proper titles
and SEO metadata for your pages. This helps with search engine rankings, accessibility,
and overall user experience.

Ever since React 19 came out it has become trivial to add titles and other metadata
to your pages using their hoisting mechanism that automatically collects metadata from
all your JSX and hoists it into the documents head.

This JSX:

```jsx
function SomeComponent() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello World</h1>
      <title>My Page Title</title>
      <meta name="description" content="My Page Description" />
    </>
  )
}
```

Would hoist the `<title>` and `<meta>` tags into the document head for you automatically,
which would produce the following HTML:

```html
<head>
  <title>My Page Title</title>
  <meta name="description" content="My Page Description" />
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"> 
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </div>
</body>
```
 
Now that you understand how the hoisting mechanism works, let's see how we can use
this to our advantage by adding titles to our pages using React.

Every route in the project has instructions on what you need to do, go Koala hunting
and try to add titles to all the pages!

In this exercise, we're going to use the `meta` export to add titles to our pages.

Here's a quick overview of how the `meta` export works:
- The `meta` export is a function that returns an object containing metadata for the route.
- The keys of the object correspond to the metadata properties, such as `title`, `description`, etc.
- The values of the object are the values of the metadata properties.
Here's an example of how to use the `meta` export to add a title to a route:

```tsx
import { MetaFunction } from 'react-router'

export const meta: MetaFunction = () => {
  return {
    title: 'My Page Title',
    description: 'My Page Description',
  }
}
```
