# Adding styles and fonts to our apps

In this exercise we will learn how to add styles and fonts to our React Router apps
using the `links` export.

## Using vite to import stylesheets and handle CSS

Because react-router framework mode uses vite, we can take advantage of
vite's ability to import stylesheets directly in our JavaScript and TypeScript files.

This means that we can import our global stylesheets directly in our `root.tsx` file as
side-effect imports, like so:

```ts
import './styles/global.css'
```

and this would work out of the box! Vite also supports a lot of other CSS styling approaches
like CSS modules, PostCSS and more!

To learn more about all the benefits you get by using Vite you can check out the vite documentation:

## Understanding the `links` export

Before you begin adding styles and fonts to your app, it's important to understand how the `links` export works.
The `links` export is a function that returns an array of `<link>` elements to be included in the
`<head>` of your document. This is where you can add your global stylesheets and font links and whatever
else you might need in the head of your document.

What is important to know is the links export returns an array of object, where each object represents
a single `<link>` element. The keys of the object correspond to the attributes of the `<link>` element.
Where the values of the object are the values of the attributes.

One last thing to keep in mind is that this export is just a regular JavaScript function, so you can use
any JavaScript features you want to generate the array of link objects dynamically. You can include/exclude
links based on environment variables, or any other logic you might need.

Here's an example of how to use the `links` export:

```tsx
import { LinksFunction } from 'react-router'

// imagine this jsx was in the document
;((<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/global.css" />),
	(
		<link
			href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:ital,opsz,wght@0,14..32,100..900;1,14..32,100..900&display=swap"
			rel="stylesheet"
		/>
	))

export const links: LinksFunction = () => [
	{ rel: 'stylesheet', href: '/styles/global.css' },
	{
		href: 'https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:ital,opsz,wght@0,14..32,100..900;1,14..32,100..900&display=swap',
		rel: 'stylesheet',
	},
]
```

## Exercise overview

In this exercise, we're adding a global stylesheet and a Google Fonts link to our app.
To get started head to the `root.tsx` and find the exercise instructions there!

Bonus points if you preconnect to the Google Fonts domain to speed up font loading! ðŸš€
