# Adding styles and fonts to our apps

In this exercise we will learn how to add styles and fonts to our React Router apps 
using the `links` export.

## Understanding the `links` export

Before you begin adding styles and fonts to your app, it's important to understand how the `links` export works. The `links` export is a function that returns an array of `<link>` elements to be included in the `<head>` of your document. This is where you can add your global stylesheets and font links.

Here's an example of how to use the `links` export:

```tsx
import { LinksFunction } from 'react-router'

// imagine this jsx was in the document
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/global.css" />, 
<link
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:ital,opsz,wght@0,14..32,100..900;1,14..32,100..900&display=swap"
  rel="stylesheet"
/>


export const links: LinksFunction = () => [
  { rel: "stylesheet", href: "/styles/global.css" }, 
  {
    href: "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:ital,opsz,wght@0,14..32,100..900;1,14..32,100..900&display=swap",
    rel: "stylesheet"
  }
]
```

In this example, we're adding a global stylesheet and a Google Fonts link to our app. 
The `links` export is a powerful way to manage your app's styles and fonts in a centralized location.
